## Intro to Object Oriented Programming with C# :smile:

### This repo exists to help beginners to programming in general or beginners to object-oriented programming learn the basics of C#!

So I'm Lauren, a front-end developer who is on her way and **determined** to become full-stack.

I didn't start developing seriously until July 2019. As someone who is new to the world of software development and has more experience with frontend development than backend, C# was a new beast to me.

I'm a notetaker, and I love to help people learn. So this is my attempt to spread my knowledge for others also!
I DO NOT consider myself an expert. This is merely a consolidation of my random notes taken from resources I've used to learn on my own, whether its videos, articles, or people.

**However, I hope my notes and explanations can help you too** :heart:
