## Intro to Object Oriented Programming with C# :smile:

### This repo exists to help beginners to programming in general or beginners to object-oriented programming learn the basics of C#!

As someone who is new to the world of software development and primarily has experience with front-end development, C# was a new beast to me, so these are the notes I took for myself to learn the basics of OOP and C#.

**Hope these help you too** :heart:
